              Send a notification of a print error to a valid device

              ### Information
              This automation will let you send a notification of each new top-level error from your Bambu printer that requires immediate attention.

              It will not notify you for each unique HMS information push, only print errors which usually halt prints.

              You can send notifications to the following:
                - Home Assistant Notification Centre
                - Mobile-App push notifications (via HA mobile_app)
                - Amazon Alexa Speakers TTS announcements (via alexa media player integration)
                - Desktop notification centres (via HASS Agent integration)

              For mobile-apps, you can also optionally choose a camera or image entity to send to the push notification. When blank, it will not send an image.

              Additionally, you can now also set any number of custom actions to run on print error.
